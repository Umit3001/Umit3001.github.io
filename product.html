					Heart rate monitor
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						A heart rate monitor (HRM) is a personal monitoring device that allows one to measure/display heart rate 
						in real time or record the heart rate for later study. It is largely used to gather heart rate data 
						while performing various types of physical exercise. Measuring electrical heart information is 
						referred to as <strong>electrocardiography</strong> (ECG or EKG).Medical heart rate monitoring used in hospitals 
						is usually wired and usually multiple sensors are used.Consumer heart rate monitors are designed
						for everyday use and do not use wires to connect.

					What does this solve?
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						<strong>Prioritizing recovery</strong> is one of the best forms of heart rate monitor training and especially useful 
						for a recovery run. Put on the chest strap and program your HRM to beep if your heart rate exceeds 
						70-75 percent of your maximum. This simple strategy reigns in your enthusiasm when you might overdo your recovery runs.
						Not only are you allowing your body (heart, muscles, connective tissue) to recover, but also your brain.
						Most of us only think about the physical side of recovery, but the brain needs time to rest as well.

					How to use
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						With your zones properly set up, you can now use your heart rate monitor to more accurately train 
						and work on specific fitness limiters. Address your weaknesses as they relate to your key event, 
						then work to improve those areas. As Coach Forbes says, “Training with heart rate and knowing your
						zones will allow you to scale your efforts correctly. <em>First</em>, it will allow you to build a plan 
						specifically for your event or goal. Heart rate training and monitoring the data will help prevent 
						over-training and allow you to customize training,” he comments.

					Celebrity's view
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						A heart-rate monitor may sound old-school, <em>but</em> it's a secret weapon of today's leading ladies.
						"When Lauren Graham was trying to get cover-ready for a magazine shoot," says Lovitt,
						"I did a combo of interval training, biking and hiking, but used her heart rate as a guide to make
						sure she was in the fat-burning zone." That means working out at 60 to 85 percent of your max heart
						rate, a sweet spot where your body is actively burning fat for energy. "People get frustrated when
						they've been busting their butt, but the weight isn't budging," Lovitt says. "A simple change like
						a heart-rate monitor can help the weight melt right off."

					What brings the company
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						The Apple Watch operates in conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as configuring 
						the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for
						data-reliant purposes, including communications, app use, and audio streaming.LTE-equipped
						models can also perform these functions over a mobile network, and can make and receive phone calls
						independently when the paired iPhone is not nearby or is powered-off, substantially reducing the 
						need for an iPhone after initial setup.

					The future
				</header>
					<p class = "articleParagraph">
						Everyday personal wearable devices that include monitoring, like the Apple Watch or Fitbit, will
						also undoubtedly play a role in heartrate monitoring. In the future, apps will accurately provide 
						two-way communication between physicians and their patients. It’s not far-fetched to think that
						a watch or similar device could recognize a heart abnormality and lay the foundation for more
						targeted tests. The future looks big for Heart rate monitors, but of course only time wil tell.
